ECUACORRIENTE,"EcuaCorriente S.A. es una empresa ecuatoriana constituida en 1999, dedicada a las labores mineras en todas sus fases, y es la única empresa minera, hasta la fecha, que ha suscrito el Contrato de Explotación Minera y el Contrato de Inversión con el Estado Ecuatoriano.

La historia, no obstante, inició mucho antes, en 1994, con la exploración de yacimientos de oro a cargo de la compañía Gencor. En 1996 la compañía Billiton descubrió el Cinturón de mineralización tipo cobre porfídico en la Cordillera del Cóndor; en 1999 cedió los derechos a la compañía canadiense Corriente Resources.

En el año 2000 EcuaCorriente S.A. descubrió una anomalía de cobre y posteriormente un yacimiento del mismo mineral. En 2005 se determinó que el proyecto es viable económica, social y ambientalmente. En el 2006 el Ministerio de Energía y Minas aprobó el Estudio de Impacto Ambiental y Plan de Manejo Ambiental para la Explotación del Proyecto Mirador.

En el 2008, Ecuador vivió una etapa de transición por la elaboración de la nueva Constitución, durante ese período la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente emitió el Mandato 6, suspendiendo las operaciones mineras hasta la elaboración de la nueva Ley de Minería, que entró en vigencia en enero de 2009, y su Reglamento en noviembre de mismo año.

En noviembre de 2009, el Ministerio de Recursos Naturales No Renovables otorgó a EcuaCorriente S.A. la autorización para reanudar las actividades en el proyecto de cobre Mirador.

En mayo de 2010, el consorcio chino CRCC-Tongguan adquirió EcuaCorriente S.A. y las empresas relacionadas, en la certeza de que la industria minera y el Ecuador son destino de inversiones.

En marzo de 2012, EcuaCorriente y el Estado Ecuatoriano firmaron el Contrato de Explotación Minera del Proyecto Mirador, verificando que la compañía cuenta con todos los permisos y condiciones para llevar con éxito este gran desafío nacional.",http://www.corriente.com.ec/,Mining & Metals,"501-1,000 employees",,Self-Employed,1999.0,,17.0,49.0,42.0,18.0,23.0,0.0,38.0,19.0,37.0,0.0,21.0,0.0,23.0,0.0,20.0,23.0,20.0,15.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ANDES PETROLEUM ECUADOR LTD.,"Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd. operates in the Tarapoa Block and the Lago Agrio Storage and Transfer Station in the province of Sucumbios.

PetroOriental S.A. operates in Blocks 14 and 17 in the province of Orellana and Pastaza.
These companies were set up with shareholder capital from state-run corporations of the People's Republic of China: China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), with a 55 per cent stockholding, and China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC), with a 45 percent stake.
We have been in Ecuador since 2006 and have put together a compact multicultural, efficient, talented, highly-professional team, responsible for meeting the high productive and quality standards we have demonstrated throughout this period.

The fruits of our labour have been ostensibly beneficial for the development of Ecuador in a permanent display of our commitment to the country and its people, as you may appreciate while browsing through our pages.

LA GANGA R.C.A.,"Almacenes La Ganga empezó sus operaciones en 1983, abriendo su primer local en el sector de “La Bahía” en la ciudad de Guayaquil. Desde sus inicios el local se especializó en la comercialización y venta de electrodomésticos de las mejores marcas a nivel mundial, ofreciendo como diferencia y ventaja competitiva lo que ningún otro local daba: garantía por sus productos. Desde esta época se popularizó su slogan “Precios de Bahía con Garantía”.

Hoy Almacenes La Ganga cuenta con más de 130 locales en todo el país y busca continuar expandiéndose hasta abarcar cada rincón de nuestra patria.

Today, we employ around 273,000 people and have factories or operations in almost every country in the world. With our headquarters still based in the Swiss town of Vevey, we had sales of CHF 84.3 billion in 2020.

IMPORTADORA TOMEBAMBA,"Importadora Tomebamba S.A. se fundó en 1964, cuando varios empresarios cuencanos liderados por el Sr. Guillermo Vázquez Astudillo, forman una sociedad que con los años se convertiría en una de las empresas más importantes, serias y sólidas del Ecuador.
Desde sus inicios se caracterizó por representar vía distribución y comercialización, a marcas líderes en el mercado mundial, diferenciándose de la competencia, sobre todo por la calidad en la atención al cliente y consolidando el servicio como una prioridad de nuestras actividades.  Su primera línea de negocios fue la de vehículos TOYOTA.

SALICA DEL ECUADOR,"Salica Del Ecuador S.A belongs to Albacora group, it has the biggest tuna fleet in Europe and the only company fishing in all the oceans.
In 2002, Salica del Ecuador SA was created, an industrial complex that serves as logistic, fishing, industrial and tuna hub base that allows us to improve the different phases of the productive and commercial tuna cycle.
Started its operations in 2004 processing frozen cooked loins. 
In 2005, we expanded our processes by elaborating canneries, In 2009, in view of offering our customers the highest standards of service, we inaugurated the frozen loins plant. In 2013, Salica del Ecuador decided to expand its facilities to diversify in cannery formats and in 2016 the Pouch line was introduced.
The plant, in constant expansion, is able to obtain more than 60000 tons of fish per year and directly receive the ships on its own dock, reducing times, transport costs, logistical difficulties and avoiding breaks in the cold chain.

CASABACA,"Casabaca es una empresa que ha hecho historia en el Ecuador. Sus cimientos se remontan a la compañía José Baca y Torres fundada en 1835. A esta la sucedió Ignacio Baca y Hermanos en 1877 para luego ser fundada Baca Hermanos en 1927. 

Siguiendo esta tradición comerciante, el 13 de Junio de 1959 con la iniciativa de Juan Francisco Baca Proaño y sus hijos Gonzalo y Fausto Baca Moscoso, se funda Casabaca S.A. La actividad de Casabaca era la venta de vehículos Chrysler, Plymouth y camiones Fargo y Skoda. En ese mismo año, 1959, se hace el contacto con la empresa hasta entonces desconocida para el Ecuador, la TOYOTA MOTOR SALES. 

Luego de comprobar que sus vehículos eran de alta calidad, Casabaca obtiene su representación. Desde entonces Casabaca dio a conocer al cliente ecuatoriano las cualidades de la marca Toyota, hasta lograr lo que hoy es un símbolo de calidad.",http://www.casabaca.com/,Automotive,"501-1,000 employees","Quito, Pichincha",Privately Held,1959.0,,73.0,59.0,60.0,30.0,22.0,31.0,57.0,23.0,47.0,40.0,18.0,34.0,41.0,0.0,48.0,0.0,29.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

DITECA,"En Abril de 1994 nace DITECA S.A., una empresa creada especialmente para cubrir las necesidades del sector de la construcción y minería en el Ecuador. Comenzando en la Costa y dado el buen desarrollo de DITECA en Guayaquil, Komatsu Latin America Corp. decidió en el 2003 ampliar el campo de distribución en la Sierra y Oriente.

Su performance ha sido muy importante para el buen desarrollo de la imagen de esta marca, según la opinión de un amplio sector vinculado a la construcción. Su adecuada labor de comercialización y mercadeo ha conquistado un gran segmento de clientes.

Cabe destacar que las modernas instalaciones de DITECA S.A. se levantan sobre un predio de 20.000 m2 en Samborondón y nuestras sucursales en Quito nacen para prestar un mejor servicio y atención en la zona norte y sur del país respectivamente.

EMPAQPLAST,"Empaqplast S.A. fue fundada en el año de 1992 para atender las necesidades de los fabricantes de aceites comestibles y productos de limpieza, localizados en la sierra ecuatoriana, ya que en la década de los 90´s muy pocas industrias estaban lo suficientemente desarrolladas como para cubrir las necesidades a nivel nacional y para facilitar la logística, requerimientos de entrega y cumplimiento de los productores locales.

En este sentido y con una perspectiva de un negocio de apoyo a la sociedad productora ecuatoriana, surgió la idea de crear una empresa familiar, con 100% de capital privado.

Empaqplast S.A. se consolidó como un productor que ofrecía el mejor servicio, calidad y variedad.

Debido a esto se nos presentó la necesidad de incursionar en las áreas de soplado, inyección, extrusión, co-extrusión e impresión. En tan solo dos décadas hemos llegado a ser una de las empresas con más alta tecnología e infraestructura, lo cual nos ha convertido en una de las fábricas de plásticos más grandes a nivel nacional; todos nuestros productos están certificados y son aptos para envasar productos de consumo humano.

Actualmente, dentro de nuestra estrategia estamos incursionando en el desarrollo de nuevos nichos de mercado que nos permitan generar negocios con mayores niveles de rentabilidad, pero aprovechando la tecnología y capacidad instalada con la que contamos, así que desde el año 2013 incorporamos a nuestro portafolio de productos la fabricación de autopartes plásticas cuyo mercado objetivo son las ensambladoras automotrices del Ecuador.

En el año 2014 obtuvimos el certificado de calidad ISO 9001-2008, y en el año 2017 se renovó a la versión actualizada ISO 9001-2015.

Estamos aprobados en SMETA y URSA desde el año 2016, y nos encontramos en la implementación de BRC Packaging.",http://www.empaqplast.com/,Plastics,201-500 employees,"Sangolquí, Pichincha",Sole Proprietorship,1992.0,"envases, empaques, film, lamina, tapas, baldes, inyeccion, extrusion, soplado, PET, PEAD, PEBD, PP, POLICARBONATO, moldes, and botellas",12.0,17.0,14.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,9.0,7.0,9.0,0.0,8.0,6.0,12.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

SOLVESA ECUADOR,"SOLVESA began operations on December 30, 1986, originally under the name of ECUATORIANA DE SOLVENTES S.A. in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador.

PRIME LABORATORIO PRILAB,"Prilabsa es una empresa transnacional fundada en el año 1992, dedicándose a la comercialización de cistos de artemia, dietas alimenticias, probióticos, aditivos, equipos y accesorios con altos estándares de calidad; destinados a satisfacer las necesidades del mundo acuícola.
 
En 1997 se incorporaron las dietas larvales de Zeigler Bros. Inc. a su línea de distribución y para el año 1999 la firma Mackay Marine Brine Shrimp Co. (productor de artemia del Great Salt Lake, Utah) se integra al equipo y emprende una sólida alianza comercial. Al pasar de los años las relaciones empresariales de ambas compañías se fueron fortaleciendo a tal punto de que en el 2009, la Coop.-Artemia selecciona a Prilabsa como distribuidor de artemia en las Américas, por su amplia experiencia en el mercado y su extensa red de distribución.

Prilabsa ha podido cubrir todas las necesidades de los laboratorios de camarón, peces, camaroneras y piscicultura,  gracias al pleno conocimiento del medio ambiente y la sólida experiencia en varios mercados  de la industria acuícola.
 
Prilabsa ha expandido sus actividades en países establecidos como puntos estratégicos del continente americano, contando con oficinas comerciales modernas y bodegas climatizadas en USA (Miami), Brasil (Natal y Aracati), Ecuador (Guayaquil, Manta, Pedernales, Bahía de Caráquez, Machala, Esmeraldas, Libertad), Honduras, Nicaragua y Panamá.

Contamos con 25 años de experiencia y servicio dentro del sector, lo que evidencia que la excelencia no se improvisa, se consolida a través de la  eficiencia de cada uno de nuestro equipo de trabajo. Llegando así a convertirnos en la completa solución del sector acuícola en las Américas.",http://www.prilabsa.com/,Fishery,51-200 employees,"Guayaquil, Guayas",Privately Held,1992.0,,5.0,7.0,11.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,10.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ACADEMIA NAVAL ALMIRANTE ILLINGWORTH SA ANAI,"En el año de 1961 un grupo de oficiales de la Armada Nacional convencidos de la excelencia de la formación naval militar, acordaron formar bachilleres y ciudadanos dignos para la superación de la Patria. Por ese motivo se acordó ponerle el nombre de “Almirante Illingworth” para así hacer honor y justicia a uno de los más ilustres próceres de nuestra independencia y fundador de la Marina de Guerra del Ecuador.
En mayo de 1962 se inicia el primer período lectivo de la Academia, que comenzó sus actividades con apenas 50 alumnos repartidos entre primero y segundo curso. De año en año se fueron aumentando los cursos hasta completar los seis de secundaria.
El día 24 de noviembre de 1962 se realiza la inauguración oficial de la Academia, la bendición de la misma y sus estándares, considerándose desde entonces el día de la Academia.
En 1965 la Academia establece la enseñanza primaria empezando con quinto y sexto grado. El fundador fue el Capitán de Fragata (R) Jorge Páez Torres quien actuó como Rector.

INDECAUCHO C LTDA,"Indecaucho es una empresa de capital ecuatoriano que nace gracias a la visión de su fundador Andrés Moreno, el cual en los años 90 en pleno auge camaronero y agrícola, identificó la necesidad de protección que tenían las personas que trabajaban usando sus manos. A partir de esta premisa Indecaucho comienza la comercialización de guantes creando así una cultura de seguridad para los ecuatorianos.

Indecaucho en constante evolución y crecimiento, identificó que Ecuador es una zona estratégica para producir caucho acorde a estándares internacionales.

Las leyes establecen importantes ventajas para las empresas que se instalen en las ZEDE´s y favorecen una dinámica de colaboración entre el sector industrial y empresarial, y las universidades y los centros de investigación.",http://www.zedelitoral.ec/,Commercial Real Estate,2-10 employees,"Guayaquil, Guayas",Sole Proprietorship,2017.0,"Desarrollo económico, Beneficios aduaneros, and Zona económica especial",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Banco Solidario,"Dicen que los bancos no distinguen personas, que solo ven números, porque son exactos, fríos, no admiten equívocos, no tienen nada que ver con historias o emociones. ...se dicen muchas cosas de los bancos, pero nunca se ha dicho que son solidarios.
Y si te dijéramos que si existe un banco que es Solidario como ningún otro, que cree en el cliente y sus colaboradores por encima de todas las cosas, uno que sabe de finanzas y de personas, pero sobretodo de lucha, de esfuerzo y de sueños. Un banco que, a diferencia de la mayoría, nació con misión social,  que cree en la gente por lo que es, más que por lo que tiene; que trabaja para incluir y servir a quienes antes eran invisibles.
Un banco que no parece banco, porque se esfuerza por conocer las historias de sus colaboradores y de sus clientes, antes de ofrecerles un producto o un servicio. Un banco que se inspira en el trabajo de las personas para brindar lo mejor de sí. Un banco que jamás cierra su puerta a quien lo necesita, que entendió que sin acceso jamás habrá verdadero progreso y superación.

Banco Produbanco,"Historia

Grupo Promerica empezó su desarrollo en 1991, en Nicaragua, con el establecimiento del Banco de la Producción (Banpro). Posteriormente, a través de distintos procesos, la red bancaria expandió sus operaciones a 9 países: Nicaragua, Panamá, El Salvador, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Islas Caimán y República Dominicana. Adicionalmente, sus principales accionistas operan Terrabank, N.A., un banco comercial al servicio del sur de la Florida – EE.UU, que tiene más de 1’500,000 clientes y 6.750 colaboradores.

Desde su constitución el objetivo de Grupo Promerica ha sido contribuir de forma permanente al desarrollo de los diferentes países en los que opera, atendiendo las necesidades financieras de personas naturales y fomentando el sector productivo de cada país. Para ello, nuestra organización cuenta con el apoyo de instituciones multilaterales como: DEG, Banco de Desarrollo Alemán – Alemania, FMO, Banco Internacional de Desarrollo de los Países Bajos – Holanda, y el IFC, International Financial Corporation – USA.

Durante estos 23 años de presencia en el mercado financiero internacional ha logrado un incremento sostenido en activos, sin afectación por las crisis regionales y globales. La meta de Grupo Promerica es continuar posicionando su presencia en los diferentes mercados para fortalecer la confianza de sus clientes, contando con el compromiso de los accionistas y el esmero y dedicación de ejecutivos y colaboradores.

Ofrecemos un servicio de excelente calidad a las pequeñas y medianas empresas y a clientes privados interesados en ahorrar. En nuestras operaciones nos adherimos a una serie de principios esenciales: Valoramos la transparencia en la comunicación con nuestros clientes, no promovemos el crédito al consumo, nos esforzamos por reducir al mínimo nuestra huella ecológica, y prestamos servicios basados tanto en el entendimiento de la situación de cada cliente en particular, como en un análisis financiero sólido.
 
En nuestras operaciones con clientes empresariales, nos centramos principalmente en las pequeñas y medianas empresas, ya que estamos convencidos de que son ellas las que generan empleo y contribuyen significativamente a las economías en las que operan.

Historia

Diners Club surge en Estados Unidos en la década de los años 40. Cuenta la historia que en 1949, Frank McNamara cenaba en un restaurante de Nueva York y sorpresivamente no pudo pagar la factura, pues había olvidado su billetera. Aunque su acompañante solucionó la situación, decidió que jamás se vería en una circunstancia tan incómoda. Un año después, junto con su abogado Ralph Scneider, creó la Tarjeta Diners Club.",http://www.dinersclub.com.ec/,Financial Services,"1,001-5,000 employees",,Privately Held,1968.0,Diners Club del Ecuador comenzó su labor hace ya 40 años and fecha desde la cual se ha convertido en la empresa líder de tarjetas de crédito del país.,278.0,381.0,358.0,196.0,166.0,151.0,268.0,196.0,220.0,0.0,166.0,138.0,219.0,0.0,188.0,0.0,186.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,118.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Banco De Desarrollo,"El Banco de Desarrollo del Ecuador B.P. (BDE) es una institución financiera de la Banca Pública de Desarrollo, líder en el financiamiento de proyectos de preinversión, infraestructura, provisión de servicios públicos, obras de interés social y asesoramiento que promuevan el progreso de las economías locales. Es parte, además, del Gabinete Sectorial Económico y Productivo.

La institución fue creada el 6 de agosto de 1979, fecha desde la cual comienza su funcionamiento como persona jurídica autónoma de derecho privado con finalidad social y pública, bajo el nombre de Banco del Estado. Años más tarde, y en sujeción a lo establecido en el Decreto Ejecutivo No. 867, suscrito el 30 de diciembre de 2015, se determinó la reorganización del Banco del Estado, aprobando su nueva denominación como Banco de Desarrollo del Ecuador B.P.

Así, el BDE se constituyó como una entidad financiera pública con personería jurídica propia, autonomía administrativa, financiera y presupuestaria, regida en el ejercicio de sus actividades y en el desarrollo de servicios financieros por el Código Orgánico Monetario y Financiero, el Decreto de la referencia, las normas emitidas por la Junta de Política y Regulación Monetaria y Financiera, los organismos de control, la Junta General de Accionistas del Banco, su respectivo Directorio; y, en los demás, las normas de su Estatuto Social y las que rigen a las instituciones públicas.

Mutualista Pichincha,"El 1 de noviembre de 1961 nació Mutualista Pichincha, la más grande institución financiera en su género.

Por inspiración del señor Roque Bustamante y otros ilustres idealistas, Mutualista Pichincha dio inicio a su labor, con la finalidad de promover el ahorro para vivienda.

Mutualista Pichincha ha operado como una entidad privada, bajo el control de la Ley del Banco Ecuatoriano de la Vivienda y Mutualistas, y con sus reglamentos y estatutos; y a partir del 12 de mayo de 1994, bajo la Ley General de Instituciones Financieras.

Nuestra misión es continuar con esta labor, para que más familias ecuatorianas se beneficien con la oportunidad de tener vivienda propia.

El enfocarnos permanentemente en esta misión, nos ha permitido posicionarnos como una institución líder en el desarrollo de proyectos y soluciones de vivienda en el Ecuador.
